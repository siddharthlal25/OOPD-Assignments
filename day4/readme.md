OOSD Lab Problem Sheet 4

Implement the following in Java:

Q1. Write a code that prints:
a) Hello World
b) The sum of first 10 terms for e^x for any given real x.
c) "Yes" if a given string is a palindrome, "No" otherwise.
d) The number of prime numbers till a given positive integer n.
e) The number of numbers relatively prime to n and not greater than n, for a given positive integer n.


Q2. Translate your earlier lab assignment of implementing an AVL tree, to Java. The tree_print function should also be there.

Q3. Write a code that reads from a file input.txt a square matrix. It should then check if the matrix is the adjacency matrix of a simple graph. If yes, it should output a vertex cover of optimum size. For example, suppose the input is the following:

0 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 0
1 0 0 0 1 0 0
1 0 0 0 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 0
1 0 0 0 1 0 0

then in a file named output.txt, your code should write:
Size of min VC = 2
Min VC: 1, 5
