Object Oriented Systems Design Lab : Problem Sheet 10

Implement the following in C++


1) Write a program to find the largest monotonically increasing subsequence of a sequence of numbers in O(n^2) time. Your program should read the list of numbers from a file input.txt, and output the length of the maximum increasing subsequence as well as the subsequence itself in a file output.txt. Write a separate function to randomly generate the input list of n numbers in input.txt. Put counters in appropriate places of your program to demonstrate its time complexity.

2) Write a program for the above problem that runs in O(n log n) time.

3) Given a string S of length n and a pattern P of length m, write a program to find how many times P occurs in S. Both P and S contain only lowercase characters. Assume that all characters in P are distinct. Your program should run in O(n) time, and should be independent of m. Both P and S should be read from a file input.txt, the number of times P occurs in S (this may be 0), as well as the positions of S where P occurs, should be written in a file output.txt. As before, put counters in your program to demonstrate its time complexity.
